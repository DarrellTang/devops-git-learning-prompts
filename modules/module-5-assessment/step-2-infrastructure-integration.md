## Your Learning Prompt

```
You provide practical examples of integrating Git workflows with existing infrastructure tools and processes.
My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who has mastered basic Git workflows and wants to integrate them with their current infrastructure practices.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT mention Infrastructure as Code, Terraform, or advanced DevOps tools unless they ask specifically
- Focus ONLY on traditional infrastructure tools and processes they definitely know
- Use familiar IT terminology, not development jargon
- Examples should be basic: existing tools, change processes, documentation systems

Your task is to provide MULTIPLE EXAMPLES of how Git integrates with existing infrastructure practices without disrupting current workflows.

Provide 4 detailed integration examples:

**Example 1: Change Management Process Integration**
- Current process: Change tickets, approval boards, implementation tracking
- Git integration: Branches = change tickets, PRs = approval requests, commits = change documentation
- Show how Git enhances existing change control without replacing it

**Example 2: Documentation Workflow Integration**
- Current process: Shared drives, wiki systems, document review processes
- Git integration: Version-controlled docs, collaborative editing, review workflows
- Show how this improves on current documentation challenges

**Example 3: Configuration Management Integration**
- Current process: Config file backups, manual versioning, team sharing
- Git integration: Automatic versioning, change tracking, collaborative config management
- Show how this enhances current backup and sharing practices

**Example 4: Incident Response Integration**
- Current process: Runbooks, post-incident reviews, knowledge sharing
- Git integration: Version-controlled runbooks, collaborative updates, change tracking
- Show how this improves incident documentation and team knowledge sharing

For each example:
- Start with their current process (what they already do)
- Show specific Git integration points
- Explain benefits without disrupting existing workflows
- Address common concerns about adopting new tools
- Provide implementation suggestions

Throughout examples:
- Emphasize Git as enhancement, not replacement
- Connect to change management principles they know
- Show how Git solves current pain points
- Provide practical next steps for integration

End with: "Git enhances your existing infrastructure practices by adding powerful versioning and collaboration to tools and processes you already use."

Keep it practical and connected to their current infrastructure environment.
```

## What to Expect
You'll see 4 detailed examples of integrating Git with existing infrastructure practices - change management, documentation workflows, configuration management, and incident response - without disrupting current processes.

## Common Integration Patterns

### Infrastructure-as-Code
- Store Terraform/Ansible files in Git repositories
- Use branches for testing infrastructure changes
- Pull requests for infrastructure code review
- Version control for rollback capabilities

### Documentation
- Runbooks and procedures in Git repositories
- Collaborative editing through pull requests
- Change tracking for compliance
- Integration with documentation sites

### Automation Scripts
- Version control for all automation
- Team sharing of improvements
- Testing changes in branches
- Change history for troubleshooting

## Best Practices for Integration
- Start small with one workflow
- Train team members gradually
- Establish clear branching conventions
- Document your team's Git processes
- Regular backup of important repositories

## Questions to Consider
- Which of your current workflows would benefit most from version control?
- How can you introduce Git without disrupting critical operations?
- What training does your team need for successful adoption?
