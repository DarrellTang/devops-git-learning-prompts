# Step 2: Infrastructure Integration

## What You'll Learn
Learn how to integrate Git workflows with your existing infrastructure tools and processes.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This shows integration with common infrastructure workflows.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
Explain how to integrate Git workflows with common infrastructure tools and processes. 

Show how Git fits with: 
(1) Infrastructure-as-Code tools like Terraform or Ansible, 
(2) CI/CD pipelines, 
(3) change management processes, 
(4) documentation workflows. 

Provide specific examples of how the Git workflow enhances rather than disrupts existing 
infrastructure practices.
```

## What to Expect
You'll see how Git integrates with tools and processes you likely already use, making your existing workflows more powerful rather than replacing them.

## Common Integration Patterns

### Infrastructure-as-Code
- Store Terraform/Ansible files in Git repositories
- Use branches for testing infrastructure changes
- Pull requests for infrastructure code review
- Version control for rollback capabilities

### Documentation
- Runbooks and procedures in Git repositories
- Collaborative editing through pull requests
- Change tracking for compliance
- Integration with documentation sites

### Automation Scripts
- Version control for all automation
- Team sharing of improvements
- Testing changes in branches
- Change history for troubleshooting

## Best Practices for Integration
- Start small with one workflow
- Train team members gradually
- Establish clear branching conventions
- Document your team's Git processes
- Regular backup of important repositories

## Questions to Consider
- Which of your current workflows would benefit most from version control?
- How can you introduce Git without disrupting critical operations?
- What training does your team need for successful adoption?
