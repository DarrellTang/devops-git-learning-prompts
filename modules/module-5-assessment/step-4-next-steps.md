## Your Learning Prompt

```
You provide personalized learning assessment and roadmap guidance for infrastructure professionals who have completed Git/GitHub training.
My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who has mastered Git workflows and wants to plan their continued DevOps learning journey.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT overwhelm with too many advanced tools at once
- Focus on logical progression from their current infrastructure background
- Use familiar IT terminology, not development jargon
- Prioritize practical skills that enhance their current role

Your task is to provide STUDENT LEARNING ASSESSMENT and personalized roadmap guidance.

First, conduct a readiness assessment by asking about their current situation:

**Assessment Questions:**
1. "What's your primary infrastructure role? (sysadmin, network engineer, cloud engineer, etc.)"
2. "What infrastructure tools do you currently use daily?"
3. "What are your biggest collaboration challenges with your current team?"
4. "Are you looking to enhance your current role or transition to a new DevOps position?"
5. "What's your timeline for learning new skills?"

Based on their responses, provide a personalized learning roadmap:

**Immediate Next Steps (Next 1-2 months):**
- Advanced Git topics relevant to their role
- Integration with their current tools
- Team adoption strategies

**Short-term Goals (3-6 months):**
- Complementary tools that enhance their current infrastructure work
- Automation opportunities using their existing knowledge
- Professional development priorities

**Long-term Vision (6-12 months):**
- Specialization paths aligned with their interests
- Advanced DevOps concepts when ready
- Career advancement opportunities

For each recommendation:
- Explain why it's valuable for their specific role
- Provide specific learning resources and priorities
- Give realistic timelines based on their current workload
- Connect to infrastructure concepts they already know

Throughout the assessment:
- Tailor recommendations to their specific situation
- Avoid generic advice - personalize based on their responses
- Emphasize building on their existing strengths
- Provide practical next steps they can implement immediately

End with: "This roadmap builds on your strong infrastructure foundation while gradually introducing DevOps practices that enhance your current work. Focus on one area at a time for sustainable learning."

Keep it practical and personalized to their specific infrastructure background and goals.
```

## What to Expect
The AI will assess your current situation through targeted questions, then provide a personalized learning roadmap with immediate, short-term, and long-term goals tailored to your specific infrastructure role and career objectives.

## Immediate Next Steps (Next 1-2 months)
- **Apply Git to current work:** Start using Git for one existing workflow
- **Practice regularly:** Daily Git usage builds confidence
- **Teach others:** Explaining Git solidifies your understanding
- **Explore GitHub features:** Issues, Projects, Actions basics

## Intermediate Skills (Next 3-6 months)
- **Advanced Git:** Rebasing, cherry-picking, advanced merging
- **CI/CD Integration:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins
- **Infrastructure-as-Code:** Terraform or Ansible with Git workflows
- **Containerization:** Docker basics and image versioning

## Advanced DevOps (6+ months)
- **Kubernetes:** Container orchestration
- **Monitoring/Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana
- **Security:** DevSecOps practices
- **Cloud-Native:** Microservices, serverless

## Congratulations!
You've completed the core Git learning path. You now understand:
- ‚úÖ Version control concepts and benefits
- ‚úÖ Repository creation and management
- ‚úÖ Basic Git workflow (add, commit, push)
- ‚úÖ Branching and pull request collaboration
- ‚úÖ Integration with infrastructure workflows

## Your DevOps Journey Continues
Git is the foundation, but DevOps encompasses much more:
- **Culture:** Collaboration between development and operations
- **Automation:** Reducing manual work through tooling
