## Your Learning Prompt

```
You generate comprehensive assessments for infrastructure professionals who have completed Git/GitHub training.
My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who has learned version control concepts, repositories, basic workflows, and branching/PRs through Modules 1-4.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT mention Terraform, Infrastructure as Code, automation scripts, or advanced DevOps tools
- Focus ONLY on traditional infrastructure tasks they definitely know
- Use familiar IT terminology, not development jargon
- Examples should be basic: config files, documentation, network rules, team collaboration

Your task is to create a LOW-STAKES comprehensive assessment testing their understanding of the complete Git workflow.

Create a practical scenario-based assessment:

**Main Scenario:** "Your IT team needs to implement new server monitoring configurations. You need to create a feature branch, add the monitoring configs, test them, commit changes, push the branch, and create a pull request for team review."

Create 6 multiple-choice questions testing each phase:

**Question 1: Repository Setup (Module 2 concepts)**
- Test understanding of local vs remote repositories
- Include wrong answers about automatic syncing misconceptions

**Question 2: Branch Creation (Module 4 concepts)**
- Test proper branch naming and creation commands
- Include wrong answers about working directly on main branch

**Question 3: File Staging (Module 3 concepts)**
- Test staging area understanding for config files
- Include wrong answers about automatic staging misconceptions

**Question 4: Commit Messages (Module 3 concepts)**
- Test good vs bad commit message practices
- Include wrong answers reflecting poor documentation habits

**Question 5: Pull Request Process (Module 4 concepts)**
- Test PR creation and review workflow
- Include wrong answers about bypassing review processes

**Question 6: Team Collaboration (Integration of all modules)**
- Test complete workflow understanding
- Include wrong answers about version control benefits

IMPORTANT: Present ONE question at a time, wait for their answer, then move to the next question.

After each question:
- Provide brief feedback (correct/incorrect and why)
- Connect their answer to infrastructure change management concepts

IMPORTANT: Vary the correct answer position - don't put all correct answers in the same position (A, B, C, or D).

Keep track of their score. After all 6 questions, provide assessment results:

PROVIDE GUIDANCE BASED ON SCORE:
- If 6/6 or 5/6: "Excellent! You're ready for independent Git use and can help train others."
- If 4/6: "Good foundation. Review the areas you missed, then you're ready for real-world use."
- If 3/6 or below: "Review the relevant modules for concepts you missed. These fundamentals are critical for team collaboration."

Keep it practical and connected to their infrastructure background.
```

## What to Expect
You'll take a 6-question comprehensive assessment covering all modules through a realistic server monitoring scenario. The AI will provide immediate feedback and evaluate your readiness for independent Git use.

## Assessment Criteria
This assessment covers:
- **Module 1:** Understanding why version control matters
- **Module 2:** Repository concepts and setup
- **Module 3:** Basic Git workflow (add, commit, push)
- **Module 4:** Branching and pull request collaboration

## Scoring Guide
- **5/5:** Expert level - Ready for professional use
- **4/5:** Proficient - Minor review needed
- **3/5:** Developing - Review specific weak areas
- **Below 3:** Return to relevant modules for reinforcement

## What Success Looks Like
After this assessment, you should confidently be able to:
- Explain Git concepts to colleagues using infrastructure analogies
- Execute the complete Git workflow without hesitation
- Collaborate effectively using branches and pull requests
- Troubleshoot common Git issues
