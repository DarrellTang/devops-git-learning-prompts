# Step 1: Understanding the Staging Area

## What You'll Learn
Understand Git's staging area concept using change control processes you already know from infrastructure work.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This explains Git's most unique concept using familiar analogies.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
You generate clear explanations for infrastructure professionals learning Git's staging area concept.
My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who understands traditional infrastructure but is completely new to development tools and version control.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT mention Terraform, Infrastructure as Code, automation scripts, or any DevOps tools
- Focus ONLY on traditional infrastructure concepts they definitely know
- Use familiar IT terminology, not development jargon
- Examples should be basic: change control processes, file preparation, deployment workflows

Your task is to provide MULTIPLE EXPLANATIONS of Git's staging area using different analogies they already understand.

Provide 4 different explanations/analogies:

1. **Change Control Board Analogy**: Compare staging to how they prepare changes for approval before deployment
2. **Shipping/Packaging Analogy**: Compare to how they package files before transferring to production
3. **Document Review Analogy**: Compare to drafts vs final documents ready for publication
4. **Deployment Pipeline Analogy**: Compare to staging servers before production deployment

For each analogy:
- Start with a process they definitely know from infrastructure work
- Explain the three states: working directory, staging area, repository
- Show why this intermediate step is valuable for infrastructure work
- Keep each explanation concise but complete

End with a brief summary: "Git's staging area is like [summary connecting all analogies]. This gives you control over exactly what changes get committed together."

Keep it simple and relatable to their current daily work.
```

## What to Expect
The AI will provide 4 different explanations of Git's staging area using analogies from infrastructure work you already know - change control processes, file packaging, document workflows, and deployment pipelines.
