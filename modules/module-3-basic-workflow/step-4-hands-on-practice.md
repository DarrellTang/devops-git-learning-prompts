# Step 4: Hands-On Practice

## What You'll Learn
Practice the complete Git workflow with guided exercises using your test repository.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This provides hands-on exercises to solidify your understanding.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
Create a practical exercise where the student must demonstrate the add-commit-push workflow. 

Provide a scenario: "You've just created a simple script that backs up log files. Walk through 
the exact Git commands to add this script to your repository, commit it with an appropriate 
message, and push it to GitHub." 

Then create 3 follow-up questions that test their understanding of what each command accomplished.
```

## What to Expect
You'll get a hands-on exercise with a realistic infrastructure scenario. Follow the commands exactly as provided and answer the follow-up questions to test your understanding.

## Prerequisites
Before starting:
- Your test repository from Module 2 should be set up
- Git should be configured on your machine
- You should be able to push to GitHub

## Suggested Practice Sequence
1. **Do the AI-provided exercise first** - Follow it exactly
2. **Create your own infrastructure file** - Maybe a simple config or script
3. **Practice the workflow** - Add, commit, push your file
4. **Check GitHub** - Verify your changes appeared online
5. **Repeat with modifications** - Edit your file and commit again

## Common Issues You Might Encounter
- **Authentication errors** - Check your GitHub credentials
- **Merge conflicts** - Don't edit files directly on GitHub yet
- **Wrong directory** - Make sure you're in your repository folder
- **Staging confusion** - Use `git status` to see what's staged

## Self-Assessment Questions
After completing the exercises, you should be able to:
- Explain what each command does
- Know when to use `git add .` vs `git add filename`
- Write appropriate commit messages
- Understand the difference between committed and pushed changes

## Troubleshooting Commands
Keep these handy:
- `git status` - See current state
- `git log --oneline` - See recent commits
- `git remote -v` - Check GitHub connection
