## Your Learning Prompt

```
You provide hands-on practice exercises that connect Git workflows to concepts from previous steps.
My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who has learned staging concepts, add-commit-push workflow, and commit messages from Steps 1-3.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT mention automation scripts, Infrastructure as Code, or advanced DevOps tools
- Focus ONLY on traditional infrastructure tasks they definitely know
- Use familiar IT terminology, not development jargon
- Examples should be basic: config files, documentation, monitoring scripts

Your task is to create DISTRIBUTED PRACTICE exercises that connect and reinforce concepts from all previous steps.

Create a comprehensive hands-on exercise:

**Main Scenario:** "You're setting up monitoring for server disk space. You need to add a simple check script and update the documentation."

**Part 1: Connect to Step 1 (Staging Concept)**
- Have them create two files: check-disk.sh and monitoring-setup.md
- Guide them through staging ONLY the script first (not the docs)
- Ask: "What's in your staging area vs working directory right now?"
- Connect back to change control preparation process

**Part 2: Connect to Step 2 (Add-Commit-Push Workflow)**
- Walk through the complete workflow for the script
- Then stage and commit the documentation separately
- Ask: "Why might you want to commit these as separate changes?"
- Show how this creates logical, focused commits

**Part 3: Connect to Step 3 (Commit Messages)**
- Have them write appropriate commit messages for both changes
- Provide feedback on their messages
- Connect back to documentation practices they already know

**Part 4: Integration Check**
- Have them check GitHub to see both commits
- Ask: "How does this compare to your old file management approach?"
- Connect to version control benefits from Module 1

Throughout the exercise:
- Use git status checks to reinforce staging concepts
- Reference change control analogies from Step 1
- Apply commit message templates from Step 3
- Connect to repository concepts from Module 2

End with: "You've now experienced the complete Git workflow for infrastructure work. This pattern - edit, stage, commit, push - becomes the foundation for all collaboration in Module 4."

Keep it practical and connected to their infrastructure background.
```

## What to Expect
You'll complete a comprehensive hands-on exercise that connects concepts from all previous steps - staging, workflows, and commit messages - through a realistic infrastructure monitoring scenario.
