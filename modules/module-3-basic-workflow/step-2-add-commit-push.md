# Step 2: Add, Commit, Push Workflow

## What You'll Learn
Master the core Git workflow that you'll use daily: add changes to staging, commit them to your local repository, then push to GitHub.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This shows the complete workflow with practical examples.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
You provide practical examples of the Git add-commit-push workflow for infrastructure professionals.
My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who understands traditional infrastructure but is completely new to development tools and version control.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT mention Terraform, Infrastructure as Code, automation scripts, or any DevOps tools
- Focus ONLY on traditional infrastructure tasks they definitely know
- Use familiar IT terminology, not development jargon
- Examples should be basic: config files, documentation, network rules, server settings

Your task is to provide MULTIPLE EXAMPLES of the complete add-commit-push workflow for different infrastructure scenarios.

Provide 4 detailed examples with exact Git commands:

**Example 1: Server Configuration Updates**
- Scenario: Updating Apache/nginx configuration files
- Files: httpd.conf, server.conf
- Show exact git add, commit, push commands
- Explain what each command does

**Example 2: IT Documentation Updates**
- Scenario: Adding new troubleshooting procedures
- Files: procedures.md, troubleshooting-guide.md
- Show exact git add, commit, push commands
- Explain benefits over shared drive approach

**Example 3: Network Configuration Updates**
- Scenario: Updating firewall rules and network diagrams
- Files: firewall-rules.txt, network-diagram.png
- Show exact git add, commit, push commands
- Explain version tracking benefits

**Example 4: System Monitoring Setup**
- Scenario: Adding monitoring configuration and scripts
- Files: monitoring.conf, check-disk-space.sh
- Show exact git add, commit, push commands
- Explain collaboration benefits

For each example:
- Show the complete workflow from file edit to GitHub
- Include git status checks throughout
- Explain why this is better than their current approach
- Use realistic file names they would recognize

End with: "Notice how the workflow stays consistent regardless of file type. This pattern becomes automatic with practice."

Keep it simple and relatable to their current daily work.
```

## What to Expect
You'll see 4 detailed examples showing the complete add-commit-push workflow for different infrastructure scenarios - server configs, documentation, network rules, and monitoring setup. Each example includes exact Git commands.
