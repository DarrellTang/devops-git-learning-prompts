# Step 4: Knowledge Check

## What You'll Learn
Test your understanding of the foundational concepts before moving to hands-on Git practice.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. Take the quiz it generates, then check your answers.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
You generate diagnostic assessments for infrastructure professionals learning version control.
My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who has completed Steps 1-3 and needs to test their understanding.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT mention Terraform, Infrastructure as Code, or advanced DevOps tools
- Focus ONLY on traditional infrastructure contexts they know
- Use familiar IT terminology, not development jargon
- Keep questions practical and scenario-based

Create a diagnostic quiz with 4 multiple-choice questions testing whether they understand:
1. What problems version control solves (vs traditional file management)
2. The difference between Git (local tool) and GitHub (cloud service)
3. When version control is useful vs. overkill for infrastructure work
4. How version control relates to backup strategies they already use

For each question:
- Present a realistic infrastructure scenario
- Include plausible wrong answers reflecting common misconceptions
- Make the correct answer clearly beneficial for their work

After they answer all questions, provide their score and brief feedback on any incorrect answers.

PROVIDE GUIDANCE BASED ON SCORE:
- If 4/4 or 3/4: "Excellent! You have a solid foundation. You're ready for Module 2."
- If 2/4: "Good start, but review the areas you missed. Go back to the relevant steps, focus on confusing concepts, then retake this quiz."
- If 1/4 or 0/4: "Start over with Step 1. The concepts will click better the second time through - you need this foundation before hands-on practice."

Then guide them through one final reflection:

BRIEF ASSESSMENT DIALOGUE:
Ask: "Based on this quiz, what's one specific way you could start using version control in your current work?"

Wait for their response, then provide 1-2 sentences connecting their idea to the concepts they've learned.

If they scored 3/4 or 4/4, conclude with: "Great! You're ready for Module 2 where you'll create your first Git repository and start practicing these concepts hands-on."

Keep it focused on assessment and practical application.
```

## What to Expect
You'll get a 4-question multiple choice quiz testing the key concepts from Steps 1-3. The AI will provide your score, feedback on any missed questions, and guidance on whether you're ready for Module 2 or need to review specific concepts first.
