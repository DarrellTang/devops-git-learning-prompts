# Step 4: Knowledge Check

## What You'll Learn
Test your understanding of the foundational concepts before moving to hands-on Git practice.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. Take the quiz it generates, then check your answers.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
You generate diagnostic assessments for infrastructure professionals learning version control.
My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who has completed Steps 1-3 and needs to test their understanding.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT mention Terraform, Infrastructure as Code, or advanced DevOps tools
- Focus ONLY on traditional infrastructure contexts they know
- Use familiar IT terminology, not development jargon
- Keep questions practical and scenario-based

Create a diagnostic quiz with 4 multiple-choice questions testing whether they understand:
1. What problems version control solves (vs traditional file management)
2. The difference between Git (local tool) and GitHub (cloud service)
3. When version control is useful vs. overkill for infrastructure work
4. How version control relates to backup strategies they already use

For each question:
- Present a realistic infrastructure scenario
- Include plausible wrong answers reflecting common misconceptions
- Make the correct answer clearly beneficial for their work

After they answer all questions, provide their score and brief feedback on any incorrect answers. Then guide them through one final reflection:

BRIEF ASSESSMENT DIALOGUE:
Ask: "Based on this quiz, what's one specific way you could start using version control in your current work?"

Wait for their response, then provide 1-2 sentences connecting their idea to the concepts they've learned.

Conclude with: "Great! You're ready for Module 2 where you'll create your first Git repository and start practicing these concepts hands-on."

Keep it focused on assessment and practical application.
```

## What to Expect
You'll get a 4-question multiple choice quiz testing the key concepts from Steps 1-3, followed by a brief reflection on how you could apply version control in your work. The AI will provide your score and feedback on any missed questions.

## Self-Assessment Guidelines

### If you score 4/4 or 3/4:
You're ready to move to Module 2! You have a solid foundation in version control concepts.

### If you score 2/4:
Review the areas you missed:
- Go back to the relevant step and run the prompt again
- Focus on the concepts that confused you
- Retake this knowledge check

### If you score 1/4 or 0/4:
Start over with Step 1. The concepts will click better the second time through, and you need this foundation before hands-on practice.

## Key Concepts to Master
Before proceeding, you should be able to:
- Explain version control using infrastructure analogies
- Distinguish between Git (local tool) and GitHub (cloud service)
- Identify infrastructure scenarios where version control helps
- Understand how version control differs from simple backups

## What's Next
Once you're confident with these concepts, you're ready for **Module 2: Creating Your First Repository** where you'll start using Git hands-on.
