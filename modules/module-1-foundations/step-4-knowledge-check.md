# Step 4: Knowledge Check

## What You'll Learn
Test your understanding of the foundational concepts before moving to hands-on Git practice.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. Take the quiz it generates, then check your answers.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
Create a diagnostic quiz with 4 multiple-choice questions testing whether an infrastructure 
professional understands basic version control concepts. 

Focus on: 
(1) what problems version control solves, 
(2) the difference between Git and GitHub, 
(3) when version control is useful vs. overkill, 
(4) how version control relates to backup strategies. 

Include plausible wrong answers that reflect common misconceptions from people used to 
manual file management.
```

## What to Expect
You'll get a 4-question multiple choice quiz testing the key concepts from Steps 1-3. The questions focus on understanding, not memorization.

## Self-Assessment Guidelines

### If you score 4/4 or 3/4:
You're ready to move to Module 2! You have a solid foundation in version control concepts.

### If you score 2/4:
Review the areas you missed:
- Go back to the relevant step and run the prompt again
- Focus on the concepts that confused you
- Retake this knowledge check

### If you score 1/4 or 0/4:
Start over with Step 1. The concepts will click better the second time through, and you need this foundation before hands-on practice.

## Key Concepts to Master
Before proceeding, you should be able to:
- Explain version control using infrastructure analogies
- Distinguish between Git (local tool) and GitHub (cloud service)
- Identify infrastructure scenarios where version control helps
- Understand how version control differs from simple backups

## What's Next
Once you're confident with these concepts, you're ready for **Module 2: Creating Your First Repository** where you'll start using Git hands-on.
