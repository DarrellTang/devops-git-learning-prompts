# 1.3 Infrastructure Version Control Scenarios

**Strategy:** Multiple Examples (Strategy 1)  
**Duration:** 20-25 minutes  
**Target Audience:** Infrastructure professionals who need concrete applications

## Learning Objective
Students will see specific, realistic scenarios where version control solves infrastructure problems they likely face in their current work.

## AI Prompt

```
Generate 4 different scenarios where infrastructure professionals would benefit from version control: (1) managing server configuration files, (2) tracking infrastructure-as-code changes, (3) maintaining documentation, (4) sharing automation scripts. For each scenario, show the specific problems version control solves and what their workflow looks like without and with version control.
```

## Implementation Notes

### Required Scenario Elements
Each scenario must include:
- **Current State:** How they handle this today (manual process)
- **Pain Points:** Specific problems with current approach
- **Version Control Solution:** How Git addresses these problems
- **Workflow Comparison:** Before vs. after workflows

### Scenario 1: Server Configuration Files
**Context:** Managing config files across multiple servers  
**Pain Points:** Manual copying, lost changes, no change history  
**Focus:** Change tracking and rollback capabilities

### Scenario 2: Infrastructure-as-Code
**Context:** Terraform, CloudFormation, or Ansible files  
**Pain Points:** Coordination between team members, testing changes  
**Focus:** Collaboration and branching for safe testing

### Scenario 3: Documentation Maintenance
**Context:** Runbooks, procedures, troubleshooting guides  
**Pain Points:** Version confusion, simultaneous edits, outdated information  
**Focus:** Collaborative editing and change attribution

### Scenario 4: Automation Scripts
**Context:** Bash scripts, PowerShell, Python automation  
**Pain Points:** Script versioning, sharing improvements, testing changes  
**Focus:** Distribution and collaborative improvement

## Assessment Criteria
Generated scenarios should:
- [ ] Be realistic and relatable to infrastructure work
- [ ] Show clear before/after workflow comparisons
- [ ] Emphasize specific problems version control solves
- [ ] Use infrastructure terminology and contexts
- [ ] Demonstrate collaborative benefits, not just individual use

## Common Student Reactions
- "We already have shared drives for this"
- "Our configuration management tool handles this"
- "This seems like overkill for simple scripts"

### Responses to Address
1. **Shared Drives:** Show limitations of file-level vs. change-level tracking
2. **Config Management:** Explain how version control complements these tools
3. **Overkill Concern:** Demonstrate scaling benefits as complexity grows

## Follow-up Activities
1. Have students identify which scenario most closely matches their current work
2. Ask them to describe their current workflow for the closest scenario
3. Have them identify what problems they experience with their current approach

## Quality Review Checklist
- [ ] All 4 scenarios use infrastructure contexts
- [ ] Each shows specific workflow improvements
- [ ] Problems are realistic and commonly experienced
- [ ] Solutions demonstrate version control value, not just features
- [ ] Examples scale from simple to complex appropriately

## Connection to Assessment
These scenarios become the foundation for Module 1.4 assessment questions, testing whether students can identify appropriate version control applications.
