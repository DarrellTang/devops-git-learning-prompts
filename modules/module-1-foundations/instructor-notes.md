# Instructor Notes: Module 1

**This directory contains instructor documentation. Learners should focus on the step-by-step files.**

## Pedagogical Framework

### Module 1 Teaching Strategies

| Step | Strategy Used | Purpose | Duration |
|------|---------------|---------|----------|
| Step 1 | Multiple Explanations (Strategy 2) | Foundation concepts via analogies | 15 min |
| Step 2 | Multiple Explanations (Strategy 2) | Critical distinction clarification | 10 min |
| Step 3 | Multiple Examples (Strategy 1) | Concrete applications | 20 min |
| Step 4 | Low-Stakes Testing (Strategy 3) | Knowledge verification | 10 min |

## Learning Objectives
- Understand version control fundamentals using infrastructure analogies
- Distinguish clearly between Git (tool) and GitHub (service)
- Recognize infrastructure applications for version control
- Demonstrate readiness for hands-on practice

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "This is just backup with extra steps"
**Solution:** Emphasize collaboration and change tracking vs. point-in-time copies

### Issue: "Our config management tool already does this"
**Solution:** Show complementary relationship, not replacement

### Issue: Confusion between Git and GitHub
**Solution:** Reinforce local tool vs. cloud service analogy repeatedly

## Assessment Criteria
Students should achieve 80% on Step 4 assessment before proceeding to Module 2.

## Quality Review Notes
- All prompts should generate infrastructure-focused content
- Avoid development jargon and examples
- Connect to existing change management processes
- Provide multiple analogies for different learning styles

## Implementation Notes
- Learners copy prompts into any AI chat interface
- No specific AI tool required
- Self-paced progression through steps
- Can repeat steps if concepts unclear
