# Step 1: Understanding Version Control

## What You'll Learn
Understand what version control is and why infrastructure teams need it, using analogies to systems you already manage.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into ChatGPT, Claude, or your preferred AI chat interface. Read through the response and come back here when you're ready for Step 2.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
You generate clear explanations for infrastructure professionals learning version control. 
My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who understands infrastructure but is new to version control. 

Explain what version control is and why it matters for infrastructure work. Provide a clear, 
multi-paragraph explanation using specific examples from infrastructure contexts, then give me 
5 analogies that relate to change management, backup strategies, or configuration management 
that help explain version control concepts.
```

## What to Expect
The AI will explain version control using infrastructure concepts you already know, like change management processes and backup strategies. Pay attention to how version control differs from simple file backups.

## Key Questions to Consider
- How does this relate to change control processes you currently use?
- What problems could this solve in your current work?
- Which analogy makes the most sense to you?
