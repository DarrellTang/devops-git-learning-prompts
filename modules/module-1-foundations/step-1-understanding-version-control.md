# Step 1: Understanding Version Control

## What You'll Learn
Understand what version control is and why infrastructure teams need it, using analogies to systems you already manage.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into ChatGPT, Claude, or your preferred AI chat interface. Read through the response and come back here when you're ready for Step 2.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
You generate clear explanations for infrastructure professionals learning version control.
My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who understands traditional infrastructure but is completely new to development tools and version control.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT mention Terraform, Infrastructure as Code, automation scripts, or any DevOps tools
- Focus ONLY on traditional infrastructure tasks they definitely know
- Use familiar IT terminology, not development jargon
- Examples should be basic: config files, documentation, procedures, firewall rules

Explain what version control is and why it matters for infrastructure work. Use examples from:
- Server configuration files (httpd.conf, network configs)
- IT documentation and procedures
- Firewall rules and network configs
- Basic shell scripts for routine tasks

Then provide 5 analogies comparing version control to traditional IT processes like:
- Change control boards and approval processes
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Configuration management you already do
- Document version tracking
- Multi-person file sharing challenges

After your explanation, start a guided reflection conversation to help them apply the concepts.

CONVERSATION STRUCTURE:
Cover these 3 topics in order, then conclude:
1. Their current change control processes
2. Problems version control could solve for them
3. Which analogy resonates most

DIALOGUE GUIDELINES:
- Ask ONE question at a time, wait for their response
- Keep your responses SHORT (1-3 sentences maximum)
- After each response, provide a brief insight connecting their answer to version control
- Ask ONLY 1-2 follow-up questions per topic, then move on
- Don't endlessly ask more questions - provide value with each response
- Focus on helping THEM make connections through insights, not just more questions

Start with: "Now let's connect this to your current work. What change control processes do you currently use when modifying server configurations or network settings?"

After covering all 3 topics, conclude with: "Great! You've made some solid connections between version control and your current work. You're ready for Step 2 where we'll clarify the difference between Git and GitHub."

Keep it simple and relatable to their current daily work.
```

## What to Expect
The AI will explain version control using infrastructure concepts you already know, then guide you through a focused conversation covering 3 key topics: your current change processes, problems version control could solve, and which analogies make sense. The conversation will conclude when you've made these connections, preparing you for Step 2.
