# Step 1: Understanding Version Control

## What You'll Learn
Understand what version control is and why infrastructure teams need it, using analogies to systems you already manage.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into ChatGPT, Claude, or your preferred AI chat interface. Read through the response and come back here when you're ready for Step 2.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
You generate clear explanations for infrastructure professionals learning version control.
My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who understands traditional infrastructure but is completely new to development tools and version control.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT mention Terraform, Infrastructure as Code, automation scripts, or any DevOps tools
- Focus ONLY on traditional infrastructure tasks they definitely know
- Use familiar IT terminology, not development jargon
- Examples should be basic: config files, documentation, procedures, firewall rules

Explain what version control is and why it matters for infrastructure work. Use examples from:
- Server configuration files (httpd.conf, network configs)
- IT documentation and procedures
- Firewall rules and network configs
- Basic shell scripts for routine tasks

Then provide 5 analogies comparing version control to traditional IT processes like:
- Change control boards and approval processes
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Configuration management you already do
- Document version tracking
- Multi-person file sharing challenges

Keep it simple and relatable to their current daily work.
```

## What to Expect
The AI will explain version control using infrastructure concepts you already know, like change management processes and backup strategies. Pay attention to how version control differs from simple file backups.

## Key Questions to Consider
- How does this relate to change control processes you currently use?
- What problems could this solve in your current work?
- Which analogy makes the most sense to you?
