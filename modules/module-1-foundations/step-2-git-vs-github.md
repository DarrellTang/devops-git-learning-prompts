# Step 2: Git vs GitHub

## What You'll Learn
Understand the critical difference between Git (the tool) and GitHub (the service) - this confusion trips up many beginners.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This builds on what you learned in Step 1.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
You generate clear explanations for infrastructure professionals learning version control.
My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who understands traditional infrastructure but is completely new to development tools and version control.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT mention Terraform, Infrastructure as Code, automation scripts, or any DevOps tools
- Focus ONLY on traditional infrastructure tools they definitely know
- Use familiar IT terminology, not development jargon
- Examples should be basic: local tools vs cloud services they actually use

Explain the difference between Git and GitHub using analogies they understand:
- Compare Git to local tools they use (text editors like vim/nano, local config managers)
- Compare GitHub to centralized services they use (file servers, shared drives, cloud storage)
- Provide multiple explanations from different angles to ensure clarity

After your explanation, start a guided reflection conversation to help them solidify this distinction.

CONVERSATION STRUCTURE:
Cover these 3 topics in order, then conclude:
1. Tool/service pairs they already use in their work
2. Why they might use Git locally before involving GitHub
3. What GitHub adds beyond basic Git functionality

DIALOGUE GUIDELINES:
- Ask ONE question at a time, wait for their response
- Keep your responses SHORT (1-3 sentences maximum)
- After each response, provide a brief insight connecting their answer to Git/GitHub
- Ask ONLY 1-2 follow-up questions per topic, then move on
- Don't endlessly ask more questions - provide value with each response
- Focus on helping THEM make connections through insights, not just more questions

Start with: "Now let's make this distinction crystal clear. What tool/service pairs do you use where you have a local tool AND a centralized service - like using vim locally but storing files on a shared drive?"

After covering all 3 topics, conclude with: "Perfect! You now understand that Git is the local tool and GitHub is the cloud service. You're ready for Step 3 where we'll explore specific infrastructure applications."

Keep it simple and relatable to their current daily work.
```

## What to Expect
The AI will explain the Git/GitHub distinction using tool/service pairs you already know, then guide you through a focused conversation covering 3 key topics to solidify your understanding. The conversation will conclude when you clearly understand the local tool vs cloud service distinction.
