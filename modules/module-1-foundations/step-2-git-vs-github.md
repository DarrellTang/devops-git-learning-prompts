# Step 2: Git vs GitHub

## What You'll Learn
Understand the critical difference between Git (the tool) and GitHub (the service) - this confusion trips up many beginners.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This builds on what you learned in Step 1.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
Explain the difference between Git and GitHub to an infrastructure professional who might confuse them. Use analogies they understand: compare Git to a tool they use locally (like a text editor or configuration manager) and GitHub to a centralized service they use (like a file server or cloud storage). Provide multiple explanations from different angles to ensure they understand this critical distinction.
```

## What to Expect
The AI will help you understand that Git is a local tool (like vim or nano) while GitHub is a cloud service (like AWS S3 or Google Drive). You can use Git without GitHub.

## Key Questions to Consider
- Can you think of other tool/service pairs you use (like local text editor + Google Docs)?
- Why might you want to use Git locally before involving GitHub?
- What does GitHub add beyond what Git provides?
