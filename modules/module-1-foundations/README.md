# Module 1: Foundation Concepts

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, learners will:
- Understand what version control is and why it's essential for infrastructure work
- Distinguish between Git and GitHub
- Recognize scenarios where version control solves real infrastructure problems
- Connect version control concepts to familiar infrastructure practices

## Submodules

### [1.1 Version Control Fundamentals](./1.1-version-control-fundamentals.md)
**Strategy:** Multiple Explanations (Strategy 2)  
**Purpose:** Establish foundational understanding of version control using infrastructure analogies  
**Duration:** 15-20 minutes

### [1.2 Git vs GitHub Distinction](./1.2-git-vs-github.md)
**Strategy:** Multiple Explanations (Strategy 2)  
**Purpose:** Clarify the critical difference between Git (tool) and GitHub (service)  
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes

### [1.3 Infrastructure Version Control Scenarios](./1.3-infrastructure-scenarios.md)
**Strategy:** Multiple Examples (Strategy 1)  
**Purpose:** Show concrete applications of version control in infrastructure work  
**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

### [1.4 Foundation Assessment](./1.4-foundation-assessment.md)
**Strategy:** Low-Stakes Testing (Strategy 3)  
**Purpose:** Verify understanding before moving to practical implementation  
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes

## Expected Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, learners should be able to:
- Explain version control in their own words using infrastructure analogies
- Correctly distinguish between Git (the tool) and GitHub (the service)
- Identify situations where version control would improve their current workflows
- Recognize version control as an evolution of change management practices they already know

## Common Misconceptions to Address

1. **"Version control is just for developers"** - Emphasize infrastructure applications
2. **"Git and GitHub are the same thing"** - Reinforce the local vs. cloud distinction
3. **"This is just fancy backup"** - Explain collaboration and change tracking benefits
4. **"Too complex for simple config files"** - Show how it scales from simple to complex

## Module Flow

```
1.1 Fundamentals → 1.2 Git vs GitHub → 1.3 Scenarios → 1.4 Assessment
```

## Next Module Connection

Module 2 will build on these concepts by showing how to actually create and work with repositories, connecting the theoretical understanding to practical implementation.
