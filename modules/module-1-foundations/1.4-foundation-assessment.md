# 1.4 Foundation Assessment

**Strategy:** Low-Stakes Testing (Strategy 3)  
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes  
**Target Audience:** Infrastructure professionals completing foundation concepts

## Learning Objective
Students will demonstrate understanding of core version control concepts through diagnostic questions that reveal comprehension gaps before moving to practical implementation.

## AI Prompt

```
Create a diagnostic quiz with 4 multiple-choice questions testing whether an infrastructure professional understands basic version control concepts. Focus on: (1) what problems version control solves, (2) the difference between Git and GitHub, (3) when version control is useful vs. overkill, (4) how version control relates to backup strategies. Include plausible wrong answers that reflect common misconceptions from people used to manual file management.
```

## Implementation Notes

### Question 1: Problem-Solving Focus
**Concept:** What core problems version control addresses  
**Good Distractors:**
- File backup solutions
- Access control systems
- Configuration management tools

### Question 2: Git vs GitHub Distinction
**Concept:** Local tool vs. cloud service relationship  
**Good Distractors:**
- "They're the same thing"
- "GitHub owns Git"
- "You need GitHub to use Git"

### Question 3: Appropriate Use Cases
**Concept:** When version control adds value vs. overhead  
**Good Distractors:**
- "Only for large teams"
- "Only for code files"
- "Too complex for simple configurations"

### Question 4: Backup Relationship
**Concept:** How version control relates to/differs from backup strategies  
**Good Distractors:**
- "It's just automated backup"
- "Replaces backup needs entirely"
- "Only for disaster recovery"

## Assessment Criteria
Quality quiz questions should:
- [ ] Test understanding, not memorization
- [ ] Use infrastructure scenarios in questions
- [ ] Include realistic wrong answers based on common misconceptions
- [ ] Provide explanations for correct answers
- [ ] Connect concepts to their existing knowledge

## Common Misconceptions to Test

### "Version Control = Backup"
Test understanding of change tracking vs. point-in-time copies

### "Only for Developers"
Test recognition of infrastructure applications

### "Git = GitHub"
Test local vs. cloud service distinction

### "Too Complex for Simple Files"
Test understanding of scaling benefits

## Answer Key Requirements
For each correct answer, explanation should:
- [ ] Reinforce the correct concept
- [ ] Explain why wrong answers are incorrect
- [ ] Connect to infrastructure contexts
- [ ] Reference previous module content

## Follow-up Activities Based on Results

### High Scores (80%+)
- Proceed to Module 2
- Optional: peer teaching exercise

### Medium Scores (60-80%)
- Review specific weak areas
- Additional examples in problem areas
- Retry assessment after review

### Low Scores (<60%)
- Return to previous submodules
- Additional explanation prompts for weak concepts
- One-on-one discussion of misconceptions

## Quality Review Checklist
- [ ] Questions test conceptual understanding
- [ ] Distractors reflect realistic misconceptions
- [ ] All questions use infrastructure contexts
- [ ] Answer explanations reinforce learning objectives
- [ ] Assessment difficulty appropriate for target audience

## Module Completion Criteria
Students should achieve 80% or better on this assessment before proceeding to Module 2. Lower scores indicate need for concept reinforcement before practical application.

## Data Collection for Course Improvement
Track common wrong answers to:
- Identify persistent misconceptions
- Improve explanations in previous submodules
- Refine analogies that aren't working
- Adjust question difficulty appropriately
