# 1.1 Version Control Fundamentals

**Strategy:** Multiple Explanations (Strategy 2)  
**Duration:** 15-20 minutes  
**Target Audience:** Infrastructure professionals new to version control

## Learning Objective
Students will understand what version control is and why it's essential for infrastructure work through multiple explanations and analogies connected to their existing knowledge.

## AI Prompt

```
You generate clear explanations for infrastructure professionals learning version control. My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who understands infrastructure but is new to version control. Explain what version control is and why it matters for infrastructure work. Provide a clear, multi-paragraph explanation using specific examples from infrastructure contexts, then give me 5 analogies that relate to change management, backup strategies, or configuration management that help explain version control concepts.
```

## Implementation Notes

### Key Points to Cover
- What version control tracks (changes over time)
- Why manual file management fails at scale
- How version control enables collaboration
- Connection to change management processes they already know

### Effective Analogies to Request
1. **Change Control Process** - Version control as formal change management
2. **Backup Strategy** - But with intelligence about what changed
3. **Configuration Management** - Tracking system state over time
4. **Network Topology Maps** - Documenting infrastructure evolution
5. **Incident Response Logs** - Recording what happened when

### Assessment Criteria
After using this prompt, the generated content should:
- [ ] Use infrastructure terminology, not development jargon
- [ ] Connect to processes the learner already knows
- [ ] Provide concrete examples of infrastructure problems version control solves
- [ ] Include multiple ways to think about the same concept

## Common Student Questions
- "Isn't this just backing up files with timestamps?"
- "Why not just use shared network drives?"
- "How is this different from configuration management tools?"

## Follow-up Activities
1. Have students identify 3 current manual processes that could benefit from version control
2. Ask them to explain version control to a colleague using one of the provided analogies
3. Connect this to Module 1.2 by asking: "If this is version control, what's the difference with Git and GitHub?"

## Quality Review Checklist
- [ ] Explanations avoid development-specific examples
- [ ] Analogies connect to infrastructure practices
- [ ] Content addresses the "why" not just the "what"
- [ ] Multiple perspectives provided for different learning styles
