# Step 3: Infrastructure Applications

## What You'll Learn
See concrete, realistic examples of how version control solves problems you likely face in your infrastructure work right now.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This will show you specific scenarios where version control makes infrastructure work easier and safer.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
Generate 4 different scenarios where infrastructure professionals would benefit from version control: (1) managing server configuration files, (2) tracking infrastructure-as-code changes, (3) maintaining documentation, (4) sharing automation scripts. For each scenario, show the specific problems version control solves and what their workflow looks like without and with version control.
```

## What to Expect
You'll see four realistic scenarios comparing how you might handle these tasks today vs. how version control changes the workflow. Pay attention to the collaboration and safety benefits.

## Key Questions to Consider
- Which scenario sounds most like your current work?
- What problems do you face with your current approach to these tasks?
- How would collaboration with teammates change in each scenario?
- Which benefits seem most valuable for your work environment?

## Reflection Exercise
After reading the scenarios, pick the one closest to your current work and write down:
1. How you currently handle this type of task
2. What problems you experience
3. Which version control benefits would help you most
