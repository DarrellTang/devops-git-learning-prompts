# Step 4: Team Collaboration Practice

## What You'll Learn
Practice the complete collaborative Git workflow, integrating branching, pull requests, and team coordination.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This provides a comprehensive collaboration exercise.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
Create 3 review questions that connect basic Git operations (add-commit-push from Module 3) 
to branching concepts (Module 4). 

Show how the same staging and commit process works on feature branches, and create scenarios 
where infrastructure professionals would stage changes on a branch before creating a pull request. 

Include one question that requires them to trace through the complete workflow from branch 
creation to merge.
```

## What to Expect
You'll get review questions that test your understanding of how all the Git concepts work together in a collaborative environment.

## Complete Workflow Review
Now you should understand the full process:

1. **Create branch** for your feature/fix
2. **Switch to branch** to work in isolation
3. **Make changes** to files
4. **Add and commit** changes (same as Module 3)
5. **Push branch** to GitHub
6. **Create pull request** for review
7. **Address feedback** if needed
8. **Merge** when approved

## Team Collaboration Best Practices
- **Always create branches** for changes
- **Write clear PR descriptions** explaining your changes
- **Test thoroughly** before creating PR
- **Review others' PRs** promptly and constructively
- **Keep branches focused** on single features/fixes

## Self-Assessment Questions
After completing this module, you should be able to:
- Explain when and why to create a branch
- Navigate between branches safely
- Create professional pull requests
- Understand the review and merge process

## What's Next
You now have the core Git skills used in 80-90% of DevOps work:
- Version control concepts
- Repository management
- Basic Git workflow (add, commit, push)
- Branching and pull requests

Module 5 will help you integrate these skills and assess your readiness for real-world application.
