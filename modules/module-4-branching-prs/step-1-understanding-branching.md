# Step 1: Understanding Branching

## What You'll Learn
Understand Git branching using familiar test environment and change management concepts from infrastructure work.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This explains branching using concepts you already know.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
Explain Git branching to a cloud engineer by comparing it to creating isolated test environments. Show how branching allows them to experiment with infrastructure changes without affecting the main configuration. Provide multiple explanations: one using environment isolation analogy, one using document versioning analogy, and one using parallel work streams analogy.
```

## What to Expect
The AI will explain branching using familiar infrastructure concepts like test environments, staging areas, and parallel development workflows.

## Key Concepts to Understand
- **Main branch** = Production environment (stable, tested)
- **Feature branch** = Test environment (experimental, isolated)
- **Switching branches** = Moving between environments
- **Merging** = Promoting tested changes to production

## Why Branching Matters for Infrastructure
- Test changes without affecting production
- Work on multiple features simultaneously
- Collaborate without conflicts
- Easy rollback if something breaks

## Questions to Consider
- How is this similar to creating test VMs for configuration changes?
- Why might you want multiple people working on different branches?
- How does this relate to your current change management process?
