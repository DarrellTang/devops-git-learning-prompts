# Step 1: Understanding Branching

## What You'll Learn
Understand Git branching using familiar test environment and change management concepts from infrastructure work.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This explains branching using concepts you already know.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
You generate clear explanations for infrastructure professionals learning Git branching concepts.
My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who understands traditional infrastructure but is completely new to development tools and version control.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT mention Terraform, Infrastructure as Code, automation scripts, or any DevOps tools
- Focus ONLY on traditional infrastructure concepts they definitely know
- Use familiar IT terminology, not development jargon
- Examples should be basic: test environments, document workflows, parallel work processes

Your task is to provide MULTIPLE EXPLANATIONS of Git branching using different analogies they already understand.

Provide 4 different explanations/analogies:

1. **Test Environment Analogy**: Compare branches to creating isolated test environments where you can safely experiment without affecting production
2. **Document Versioning Analogy**: Compare to working on different versions of documentation or procedures simultaneously
3. **Parallel Work Streams Analogy**: Compare to multiple team members working on different aspects of a project simultaneously
4. **Change Control Analogy**: Compare to having separate change tracks for different types of infrastructure modifications

For each analogy:
- Start with a process they definitely know from infrastructure work
- Explain main branch = production, feature branch = test/development
- Show how branches allow safe experimentation and parallel work
- Explain merging as promoting tested changes to production
- Keep each explanation concise but complete

End with a brief summary: "Git branching is like [summary connecting all analogies]. This allows safe experimentation and team collaboration without conflicts."

Keep it simple and relatable to their current daily work.
```

## What to Expect
The AI will provide 4 different explanations of Git branching using analogies from infrastructure work you already know - test environments, document workflows, parallel work streams, and change control processes.
