# Step 2: Creating Your GitHub Repository

## What You'll Learn
Walk through creating your first GitHub repository step-by-step, understanding each option and setting.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This will guide you through actually creating a repository.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
A network engineer needs to share their server automation scripts with their team. Walk them through creating a GitHub repository and connecting their local Git repository to it, using terminology they understand from network file shares and centralized storage. Provide exact steps for the GitHub web interface and explain each option they'll encounter.
```

## What to Expect
You'll get step-by-step instructions for creating a GitHub repository, with explanations of all the options you'll see (public vs private, README files, etc.) in terms familiar to infrastructure professionals.

## Prerequisites
- You'll need a GitHub account (free at github.com)
- Basic understanding of repositories from Step 1

## Follow-Up Action
After getting the instructions, actually create a test repository on GitHub. You can call it something like "infrastructure-learning" or "git-practice". This will be your sandbox for learning Git commands.

## Repository Settings to Choose
When creating your repository:
- **Name:** Something descriptive like "git-learning-sandbox"
- **Public/Private:** Public is fine for learning (no sensitive data)
- **Initialize with README:** Yes (this creates your first file)
- **Add .gitignore:** None for now
- **Add license:** None for now

## Key Questions to Consider
- Why might you choose public vs private for different types of infrastructure work?
- What's the purpose of the README file?
- How does this relate to shared directories you've set up before?
