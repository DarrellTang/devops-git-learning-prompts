# Step 4: Environment Setup Check

## What You'll Learn
Verify that you have the necessary tools installed and configured to start using Git commands in the next module.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This will give you a checklist to verify your setup.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
You provide practical setup guidance for infrastructure professionals preparing to use Git commands.
My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who understands traditional infrastructure but is completely new to development tools and version control.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT mention Terraform, Infrastructure as Code, automation scripts, or any DevOps tools
- Focus ONLY on traditional infrastructure concepts they definitely know
- Use familiar IT terminology, not development jargon
- Examples should be basic: command line tools, software installation, authentication

Create a step-by-step environment setup checklist for someone who wants to start using Git:
- How to verify Git is installed on their system
- Basic configuration steps (name and email)
- GitHub authentication setup (HTTPS vs SSH)
- Provide both Windows and Linux/Mac instructions
- Focus on practical steps without overwhelming technical details

After providing the checklist, start a guided reflection conversation to help them troubleshoot and understand their setup.

CONVERSATION STRUCTURE:
Cover these 3 topics in order, then conclude:
1. Which operating system they're using and any installation challenges
2. Authentication method choice (HTTPS vs SSH) for their environment
3. Any corporate/network restrictions they need to consider

DIALOGUE GUIDELINES:
- Ask ONE question at a time, wait for their response
- Keep your responses SHORT (1-3 sentences maximum)
- After each response, provide a brief insight or troubleshooting tip
- Ask ONLY 1-2 follow-up questions per topic, then move on
- Don't endlessly ask more questions - provide value with each response
- Focus on helping THEM solve practical setup issues

Start with: "Let's make sure you're ready for hands-on Git work. What operating system are you using - Windows, Linux, or Mac?"

After covering all 3 topics, conclude with: "Great! You're set up to start using Git commands. You're ready for Module 3 where you'll learn the basic Git workflow with add, commit, and push."

Keep it simple and relatable to their current daily work.
```

## What to Expect
You'll get a practical setup checklist, then engage in a conversation to troubleshoot your specific environment, choose appropriate authentication methods, and address any corporate network restrictions.
