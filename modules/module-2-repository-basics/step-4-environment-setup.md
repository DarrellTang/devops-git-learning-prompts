# Step 4: Environment Setup Check

## What You'll Learn
Verify that you have the necessary tools installed and configured to start using Git commands in the next module.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This will give you a checklist to verify your setup.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
Create a step-by-step environment setup checklist for an infrastructure professional who wants to start using Git. Include how to verify Git is installed, basic configuration steps (name and email), and how to authenticate with GitHub. Provide both Windows and Linux/Mac instructions. Focus on getting them ready for basic Git commands without overwhelming technical details.
```

## What to Expect
You'll get a practical checklist to verify your development environment is ready for Git commands. This includes installation verification, basic configuration, and GitHub authentication.

## Required Tools
Before proceeding to Module 3, you need:
- **Git installed** on your local machine
- **GitHub account** created
- **Basic Git configuration** (your name and email)
- **Authentication setup** with GitHub

## Quick Verification Commands
The AI will provide these, but you should be able to run:
- `git --version` (shows Git is installed)
- `git config --list` (shows your configuration)
- Basic connection test to GitHub

## Common Setup Issues
- Git not in PATH on Windows
- SSH keys vs HTTPS authentication confusion
- Username/email not configured
- Corporate firewall blocking GitHub access

## Before Moving to Module 3
You should have:
- [ ] Git installed and accessible from command line
- [ ] GitHub account created and accessible
- [ ] Basic Git configuration complete
- [ ] Authentication with GitHub working
- [ ] Test repository created from Module 2, Step 2

## Troubleshooting Resources
If you run into issues:
1. Check your organization's IT policies for Git/GitHub access
2. Consider using HTTPS authentication instead of SSH if behind corporate firewall
3. Verify you have admin rights to install software
4. Ask your AI assistant for specific error message help
