# Step 1: Understanding Repositories

## What You'll Learn
Understand what a Git repository is using familiar file system and directory concepts from your infrastructure work.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This builds on the version control concepts from Module 1.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
You generate clear explanations for infrastructure professionals learning Git repositories.
My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who understands traditional infrastructure but is completely new to development tools and version control.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT mention Terraform, Infrastructure as Code, automation scripts, or any DevOps tools
- Focus ONLY on traditional infrastructure concepts they definitely know
- Use familiar IT terminology, not development jargon
- Examples should be basic: directories, file systems, shared drives, centralized storage

Your task is to provide MULTIPLE EXPLANATIONS of what a Git repository is, using different analogies they already understand.

Provide 4 different explanations/analogies:

1. **File System Analogy**: Compare a repository to a special directory that remembers every change
2. **Library/Archive Analogy**: Compare to how libraries track book versions and revisions
3. **Backup System Analogy**: Compare to incremental backup systems that save change history
4. **Centralized Storage Analogy**: Compare to shared network drives with audit trails

For each analogy:
- Start with something they definitely know from infrastructure work
- Explain what makes a repository "special" vs regular directories
- Show the difference between local repositories (on their computer) and remote repositories (GitHub)
- Keep each explanation concise but complete

End with a brief summary connecting all analogies: "A Git repository is like [summary of key concept from all 4 analogies]. This foundation prepares you to create your first repository in Step 2."

Keep it simple and relatable to their current daily work.
```

## What to Expect
The AI will provide 4 different explanations of what a Git repository is, using analogies from infrastructure work you already know - file systems, libraries, backup systems, and centralized storage. This gives you multiple ways to understand the concept.
