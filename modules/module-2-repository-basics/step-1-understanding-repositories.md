# Step 1: Understanding Repositories

## What You'll Learn
Understand what a Git repository is using familiar file system and directory concepts from your infrastructure work.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This builds on the version control concepts from Module 1.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
Explain what a Git repository is to a systems engineer using analogies to file systems and directory structures they already understand. Then explain what a GitHub repository adds to this concept, comparing it to centralized storage solutions they've used. Provide step-by-step guidance for creating their first GitHub repository.
```

## What to Expect
The AI will explain repositories using familiar concepts like directories, file systems, and centralized storage. You'll understand both the local concept (Git repository) and the remote concept (GitHub repository).

## Key Questions to Consider
- How is a repository different from just a regular directory?
- What makes a repository "special" compared to your normal file organization?
- How does this relate to centralized file servers you've used?
- What's the relationship between a local repository and a remote one?

## Before Moving On
Make sure you understand:
- A repository is a directory that Git tracks for changes
- GitHub repositories are centralized locations for sharing repositories
- You can have repositories locally without GitHub
- Repositories contain both your files and Git's tracking information
