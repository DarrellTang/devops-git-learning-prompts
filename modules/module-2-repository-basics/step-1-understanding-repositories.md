# Step 1: Understanding Repositories

## What You'll Learn
Understand what a Git repository is using familiar file system and directory concepts from your infrastructure work.

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This builds on the version control concepts from Module 1.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
You generate clear explanations for infrastructure professionals learning Git repositories.
My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who understands traditional infrastructure but is completely new to development tools and version control.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT mention Terraform, Infrastructure as Code, automation scripts, or any DevOps tools
- Focus ONLY on traditional infrastructure concepts they definitely know
- Use familiar IT terminology, not development jargon
- Examples should be basic: directories, file systems, shared drives, centralized storage

Explain what a Git repository is using analogies to file systems and directory structures they already understand:
- Compare to special directories with tracking capabilities
- Relate to centralized file servers and shared drives they've used
- Explain what makes a repository "special" vs regular directories
- Show the relationship between local repositories and GitHub repositories

After your explanation, start a guided reflection conversation to help them understand the concept.

CONVERSATION STRUCTURE:
Cover these 3 topics in order, then conclude:
1. How repositories compare to directory structures they currently use
2. What "tracking capabilities" means in their context
3. How this relates to centralized storage solutions they know

DIALOGUE GUIDELINES:
- Ask ONE question at a time, wait for their response
- Keep your responses SHORT (1-3 sentences maximum)
- After each response, provide a brief insight connecting their answer to repository concepts
- Ask ONLY 1-2 follow-up questions per topic, then move on
- Don't endlessly ask more questions - provide value with each response
- Focus on helping THEM make connections through insights, not just more questions

Start with: "Let's connect this to your current file organization. How do you currently organize and track changes to important configuration files or documentation?"

After covering all 3 topics, conclude with: "Perfect! You understand that a repository is like a special directory that tracks changes. You're ready for Step 2 where you'll create your first GitHub repository."

Keep it simple and relatable to their current daily work.
```

## What to Expect
The AI will explain repositories using familiar concepts like directories and file systems, then guide you through a focused conversation covering 3 key topics to help you understand how repositories relate to your current file organization methods.
