# Step 3: Local vs Remote Repositories

## What You'll Learn
Understand the critical relationship between repositories on your computer (local) and repositories on GitHub (remote).

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This explains how local and remote repositories work together.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
You generate clear explanations for infrastructure professionals learning about local vs remote repositories.
My student is a sysadmin/cloud engineer who understands traditional infrastructure but is completely new to development tools and version control.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT mention Terraform, Infrastructure as Code, automation scripts, or any DevOps tools
- Focus ONLY on traditional infrastructure concepts they definitely know
- Use familiar IT terminology, not development jargon
- Examples should be basic: local files vs shared drives, file synchronization, backups

Explain the critical relationship between local repositories (on their computer) and remote repositories (on GitHub):
- Compare to local files vs shared drives/cloud storage they already use
- Explain why they start as separate copies that need synchronization
- Address common misconceptions from direct server file editing
- Show how this differs from automatic cloud sync services they know

Use scenarios like:
- Editing config files locally vs on a shared drive
- File synchronization with services like Dropbox or OneDrive
- Local backups vs centralized backup storage
- Working offline vs online with shared resources

After your explanation, start a guided reflection conversation to solidify their understanding.

CONVERSATION STRUCTURE:
Cover these 3 topics in order, then conclude:
1. How this compares to file sync services they currently use
2. Common misconceptions they might have from server file editing
3. When they would work locally vs directly on the remote

DIALOGUE GUIDELINES:
- Ask ONE question at a time, wait for their response
- Keep your responses SHORT (1-3 sentences maximum)
- After each response, provide a brief insight connecting their answer to local/remote concepts
- Ask ONLY 1-2 follow-up questions per topic, then move on
- Don't endlessly ask more questions - provide value with each response
- Focus on helping THEM make connections through insights, not just more questions

Start with: "Think about how you currently sync files with cloud storage like Dropbox. What happens if you edit a file locally but don't sync it yet?"

After covering all 3 topics, conclude with: "Perfect! You understand that local and remote repositories are separate until you synchronize them. You're ready for Step 4 to set up your local Git environment."

Keep it simple and relatable to their current daily work.
```

## What to Expect
The AI will explain the crucial relationship between local and remote repositories using file sync analogies you already know, then guide you through a focused conversation to address common misconceptions and solidify your understanding.
