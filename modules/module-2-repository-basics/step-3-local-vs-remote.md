# Step 3: Local vs Remote Repositories

## What You'll Learn
Understand the critical relationship between repositories on your computer (local) and repositories on GitHub (remote).

## Instructions
Copy the prompt below and paste it into your AI chat. This explains how local and remote repositories work together.

## Your Learning Prompt

```
Create a diagnostic quiz with 3 multiple-choice questions testing whether an infrastructure professional understands the relationship between local Git repositories and GitHub repositories. Focus on scenarios like: when changes exist only locally vs. on GitHub, what happens when you create a repository in each location, and how the two stay synchronized. Include plausible wrong answers based on common misconceptions from people used to direct file editing on servers.
```

## What to Expect
You'll get a quiz that tests your understanding of local vs. remote concepts. This is crucial before you start using Git commands, as many beginners get confused about where their changes actually exist.

## Key Concepts to Master
Before moving on, you should understand:
- Local repository = on your computer
- Remote repository = on GitHub (or other hosting service)
- They start as separate copies that you synchronize
- Changes made locally don't automatically appear on GitHub
- Changes made on GitHub don't automatically appear locally

## Common Misconceptions Quiz Will Address
- "When I save a file, it automatically updates on GitHub"
- "GitHub and my local files are always the same"
- "If I delete something locally, it disappears from GitHub"
- "Creating a repository locally automatically creates one on GitHub"

## Self-Assessment
Take the quiz seriously - these concepts are fundamental to everything you'll do with Git. If you're unsure about any answers, review the explanations carefully.

## Before Moving On
Make sure you can explain:
- The difference between your local copy and the GitHub copy
- Why synchronization between them requires specific commands
- How this is similar to syncing files with cloud storage services
