# DevOps Git Learning Prompts

AI-powered learning prompts for teaching Git/GitHub to infrastructure professionals transitioning to DevOps, based on evidence-based pedagogical strategies from Mollick & Mollick (2023).

## Target Audience

This course is designed for technical professionals who:
- Are currently working in infrastructure roles (sysadmins, network engineers, systems engineers, cloud engineers)
- Have strong technical backgrounds but minimal development experience
- Need to learn Git/GitHub for DevOps workflows
- Understand infrastructure concepts but are new to version control

## Learning Objectives

By completing this course, learners will understand and be able to execute the core Git/GitHub workflow used in 80-90% of DevOps scenarios:

- Understanding what version control is and why it matters for infrastructure work
- Creating and managing GitHub repositories
- Basic Git workflow (add, commit, push)
- Branching and feature development
- Pull request workflow for collaboration
- Best practices for infrastructure teams using Git

## Pedagogical Approach

This course is based on "Using AI to Implement Effective Teaching Strategies in Classrooms: Five Strategies" by Mollick & Mollick (2023), incorporating:

1. **Multiple Examples** - Varied scenarios relevant to infrastructure work
2. **Multiple Explanations** - Different analogies connecting to existing knowledge
3. **Low-Stakes Testing** - Diagnostic quizzes and practical assessments
4. **Student Learning Assessment** - Tools to identify learning gaps
5. **Distributed Practice** - Connecting new concepts to previously learned material

## Course Structure

### Module 1: Foundation Concepts
- What is version control and why it matters
- Git vs GitHub distinction
- Real-world scenarios where version control solves infrastructure problems

### Module 2: Repository Fundamentals
- Understanding repositories
- Creating GitHub repositories
- Local vs remote repository concepts

### Module 3: Basic Workflow - Add, Commit, Push
- Understanding the staging area
- Basic Git commands for daily workflow
- Best practices for commit messages

### Module 4: Branching and Pull Requests
- Branch-based development for infrastructure changes
- Creating and managing branches
- Pull request workflow for team collaboration

### Module 5: Assessment and Integration
- Comprehensive practical assessments
- Common misconceptions and troubleshooting
- Integration with existing infrastructure workflows

## How to Use This Repository

Each module contains:
- **Conceptual prompts** for AI tools to generate explanations and examples
- **Assessment prompts** for creating quizzes and practical exercises
- **Student analysis prompts** for identifying learning gaps
- **Practice prompts** for reinforcing concepts

## Implementation Notes

These prompts are designed to be used with AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or similar large language models to generate educational content. Instructor oversight and validation of AI-generated content is essential, especially for technical accuracy.
